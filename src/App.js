        parts of India, primarily in Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana, Gujarat, and
        Uttar Pradesh. During the Karwa Chauth festival, married Hindu women
        dedicate the day to their husbands. Normally, women who observe this
        festival are called "Saubhagyavati" meaning "joyous and happy status of
        wifehood." The festival was emerged also as a day for celebrating
        autumn. Hindu married women enjoy the company and companionship of
        relatives and friends. As of recently, the celebration has been given a
        more religious touch. Karwa chauth is a very important as well as a
        difficult fast that all married Hindu women observe. The festival begins
        just before sunrise and ends after worshiping the moon and doing prayers
        at night. No water or food can be consumed once the sun rises. The fast
        is only broken after seeing the moon and after all rituals of that day
        have been performed. When the moon has appeared, women break the fast
        after they have offered water to the moon with a fancy karwa chauth
        thali, channi, lota and bangle designed specially for this occasion to
        break their fast. Women dress in special clothes during this festival. A
